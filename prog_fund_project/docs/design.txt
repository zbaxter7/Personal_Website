DEFINING DIAGRAM:

Inputs:
  playerNames
  hits
  atBats

Processing:
  calculate battingAvg
  calculate groupAvg
  create message

Outputs:
  playerNames
  battingAvg
  groupAvg
  message
  
SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
  BattingAverageCalculator
    For playerNames < 3
      prompt for playerNames
      prompt for hits
      prompt for atBats
      If hits > atBats Then
        display "I think you mixed up hits and at-bats! We can keep going or refresh to start over."
      battingAvg = hits / atBats
    EndFor
    groupAvg = (hits[0] + hits[1] + hits[2])  / (atBats[0], atBats[1], atBats[2])
    display groupAvg
    If battingAvg >= .750 Then
      display playerNames + " has a very high average!"
    Else If battingAvg >= .500 Then
      display playerNames + "is getting a hit over 50% of the time!"
    Else If battingAvg >= .250 Then
      display playerNames + "'s average is kind of low" 
    Else If battingAvg < .250 Then
      display playerNames + "'s average is extremely low!"
    EndIf
