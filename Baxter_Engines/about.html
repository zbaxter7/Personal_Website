        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Baxter Engines is a small local engine and machine shop owned by Gary Baxter since 1980. 
        There's no end to the variety of work we do in our shop. From small Kohler Engines to gigantic
        tractor engines, go-kart to stock car engines, we have rebuilt it all. The thing that separates us from
        other engine shops is the expert machine work we do in-between the dismantle and re-assembly of each engine.
        It might seem like there's a million different things that could go wrong on the inside, but we've seen 
        it all. Check out the <a href="services.html">Services</a> page to see the most common machine work we do, but don't hesitate to give us 
        a call or stop in and see what we can do for you.</p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>We are located on the west side of Eau Claire across the bridge that goes over I-94 from the North Crossing(312). For
        more detailed directions call us at (715) 874-4142 or observe the map below.</p>
